# Md2Pdf-Local
Preview your markdown and convert to PDF.

It's local server application powered by [Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh).
## Usage

```
deno task start
```

## Customize
You can customize via `./md2pdf.config.ts`. If it does not exist, run `deno task config` for generating template file.

Running `deno task start` also creates the same file before server starts.
